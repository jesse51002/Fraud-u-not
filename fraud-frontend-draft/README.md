# Fraud-U-Not UI

Most of the code will be found in the App.js file - please review it for comments on the current functions of the UI. Again, use this link to actually interact with the (STATIC) UI: https://snack.expo.dev/@kristom/fraud-draft <br /><br />

The config folder contains a folder with the color palette used throughout the app, and the assets folder contains the images and fonts used.
