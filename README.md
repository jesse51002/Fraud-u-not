# Fraud-u-Not

Hello! Welcome to our Fraud-U-Not application! <br /><br />

This is the repository where we will maintain and update our code. Note that, as of right now, the three main technical aspects of the application are being made independently and will be integrated in following weeks. For that reason, the application is limited in functionality - please review the comments in the uploaded GitHub files to better understand the purpose of the code, but note that it will not be possible to test or run the code at this time. <br />
That being said, the progress of the front-end will be kept updated at this link: https://snack.expo.dev/@kristom/fraud-draft. Note again that this UI is built independently of the other elements and is currently static. Please view the comments for more details on its current abilities. <br /><br />

~ The <b>mlmmodel</b> branch contains the ML Model that we are using to flag suspicious purchases <br />
~ The <b>front-end</b> branch contains the React Native scripts used to build the UI <br />
~ The <b>database</b> branch contains the database code for storing account and bank information, as well as user authentication <br /><br />

Please go through the branches for more comments on how each part works! Thank you :D
